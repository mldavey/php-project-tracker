# PHP Project Tracker
An MVC-based project tracker. Add/edit/archive projects, individual time-based entries for those projects, and view stats.

Initially, this project tracker will be able to display time-based stats about hours worked for each project in total and by week, along with the hours remaining to meet a weekly 'goal' or 'target' time. In the long-term, the user will be able to change 'week' to another time denomination or add a goal and calculate hours remaining by week, month, etc to meet that goal.

Based on the code written by [Dave Hollingworth](https://github.com/daveh/php-mvc) from his Udemy tutorial "[Write PHP Like a Pro: Build a PHP MVC Framework From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/php-mvc-from-scratch/)". The original code for routing and the custom MVC framework from scratch are his; the controllers, models, and views for the project tracker were modified/written by me.
